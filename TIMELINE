Things we have done so far:
    Gained understanding of system requirements and existing implementation.

    Installed Arch Linux in on the LAARK hardware for low overhead, easy
    administration, straight forward init scripts and generally being nice to use.

    Uninstalled Arch Linux and decided to use Debian instead because the uEye
    daemon has Sys-V init script assumptions hardcoded in.

    Decided on pipeline architecture based on small single-purpose scripts running
    as concurrent processes. They will communicate using ZeroMQ and will be written
    in Python, C++, and C as is appropriate for the task (favoring Python). This
    will be a great aid in maintenance, reliability, tuning, and testing. It also
    keeps the system modular and deterministic which will be well suited for small
    team to work on and future teams to understand and inherit.

    It will be licenced under the BSD License.

    The git version control system will be used to organize the code. It is
    currently on github at https://github.com/laark/laark

    We are discussing all development in https://xorse.campfirenow.com/room/457281
    so they can be logged and easy to access.
